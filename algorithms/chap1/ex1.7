    split 25 horses into 5 groups
    let them compete in groups: races: 5 
    let the winner compete get the fastest races: 1
    reject the slowest two horses in the winner group, and the slowest three horses in each other group. get the remaining horse = 25 - 1 - 2 - 3*4 = 10
    split into 2 groups compete get the winner  races: 2
    reject the slowest 3 in winner group and slowest 4 in other group get the last 2 horses. let them compete races 1
    total races = 5 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 9
